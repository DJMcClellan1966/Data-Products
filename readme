This simple application was created by using the existing k-means clustering
example and editing it to work with the mtcars dataset.  I have used the mtcars
dataset to allow the user to select different x, y and factor variables to create
different plots.  There is also different tabs the allow the use to use the sampleSelection
to change the summary, table or linear model.
