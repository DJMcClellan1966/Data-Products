This is my slidify presentation for my [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) data project using [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) to create an app with the mtcars dataset.  Beginning with the simple example of Iris k-means clustering, I edited and expanded it to use it to interpret the mtcars dataset. 
There are 32 observations with 11 variables `r names(mtcars)`

## I created a [shinyApp](https://djm1966.shinyapps.io/datasets) with 4 tabs

- plot
- summary
- table
- linear model

## Slide with R Code and Output

```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

## Slide with Plot
The different plots I used were
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
