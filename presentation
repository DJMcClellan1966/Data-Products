This is my slidify presentation for my [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) data project using [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) to create an app with the mtcars dataset.  Beginning with the simple example of Iris k-means clustering, I edited and expanded it to use it to interpret the mtcars dataset. 
There are 32 observations with 11 variables
`r names(mtcars)`

## I created a [shinyApp](https://djm1966.shinyapps.io/datasets) with 4 tabs.
- plot
- summary
- table
- linear model

The application allows the user to:

- Select the inputs from the dataset to run in the shinyApp.
- Select the output to be displayed on a plot, or as a summary or table
- Select variable to create a simple linear model against mpg.


## Data source
This application used the mtcars dataset that comes with rstudio, more information can be found here library(help = "datasets).
My code can be found on [GITHUB](https://github.com/DJMcClellan1966/Data-Products)


## Slide with Plot
The different plots I used are represented here in a simplified form:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(wordcloud)
par(mfrow=c(3,3))
plot(mtcars$mpg)
wordcloud(names(mtcars),colors=brewer.pal(7, "Accent"))
hist(x=mtcars$mpg)
pairs(mtcars[1:4,])
 mtscaled <-as.matrix(scale(mtcars))
        heatmap(mtscaled,
                col = topo.colors(200, alpha=0.5),
                Colv=F, scale="none")
```
